Dear Mr. Morgan:    Our legal action committee has authorized me  to prepare through the county organization for Marlon, a case  against the Board of Registration, data for the action to  be gathered on October 1, 1945, which Is Monday coming and the  date provided by law for registration during that month.    The committee decided upon the action after  studying at length a number of statements from your county  which have been referred to It dealing with divers schemes  employed, or apparently employed, by the Board at Marlon for  the sole purpose of abridging the rights of Negroes to qualify  and to prepare for voting as are outlined in both the federal  and state constitutions.    Among the complaints in this office are those  alleging that Board members deliberately absent themselves  when Negroes appear or as if forewarned by a sentry, avoid  Negro applicants.    We are ready to move off on this scheme used  against us. Merlon county has been selected as the testing  ground. As county chairman, together with our secretary, Mr.  George H, Chismf you are requested to take as many persons to  Marlon as posslole, and have your various precinct leaders In  all sections of the county do likewise. You are further requested  to have put Into affadavlt form within 48 hours of October 1  Individual cases of Irregularities.    You of course know that state law offers reglstrat  Ion to all citizens 21 years of age or over who own and have paid  all collectible taxes on $300 or more worth of real estate or, an  to those who lacking the real estate qualification can both read  and write any section of the state constitution of 1895 the offic  might submit. Any action beyond these provisions are violations.    Very truly yours,    JHMcC:MLG , John H. McCray,    STATE CHAIRMAN"

The Registration officer (chairman) is reported by  numerous persons under oath to have ignored tax receipts of  persons who, un'er the state constitution, are entitled to  voting certificates without the literacy test, being told they  ""mean nothing*.    We are striving earnestly to avoid unnecessary actions  to have the State and Federal Constitutions observed in the  process of registration in Harion county and appeal to you  finally to such action as may be hecersary to Insure proper  and due processes in this respect.

Y.    On or after Feb. 3, 1945    BOY SCOUT WEEK IS  Feb. Sth to 14th    The Boy Scouts of the nation, observing their 36th anniversary during Boy  Scout V.eek, Feb. 8th to 14th, are helping brother Scouts in war-torn lands, through  an unusual project Known as the ""Shirts-Off-Our Backs"" Campaign.    Now numbering nearly two million, the Boy Scouts and their leaders are conr  tributing used but clean and serviceable Scout uniform parts and camping equipment  to neip boys overseas resume their Scouting activities.    A special effort is being made during February to call at homes of former  members for Scout Uniforms and accessories no longer needed.    In approving thip nation-wide effort, the National Executive Board of the  Boy Scouts of America emphasized that the collection is not to be thought of us  charity, but instead a sharing by one Scout with another.    Scouts are giving up parts of their uniforms and equipment that they may not  be able to replace soon, out Scout Leadeis feel this helpfulness will create an  interest on the part of American Scouts in brother Scouts in other Lands, their .  customs and history. Since each Scout donor is asked co include his name and  address on the equipment, it is felt that friendships thus formed will contribute  to world-wide understanding.    Usable uniform parts being collected include Boy Scout and Cub Scout shirts  (without badges), hats ana caps, shorts, neckerchiefs and slides, lanyards, belts,  stockings and shoes. Eq.uipment desired for shipment overseas includes axes,  knives, mess kits, duffel bags, haversacks, sleeping bags, tents, bugles,compasses  fire making sets, first aid kits, signaling flags, whistles, and Scout literature.    The World Friendship Fund, consisting of voluntary contributions bf Boy  Scouts, will defray all shipping costs.    # # #"

On November 13, 1943 he demanded . . .    ""an immediate change"" in Administration policies, and warned that the  people ""will suffer grave hardship in impairment of their health and  production.""    The Undoing of the False Prophets ...    The opponents of the Administration who predicted that we'd not have enough  to eat failed to take into account two things:    ], The determination and vitality of the American people.    2. The fact that the New Deal farm program of the decade preceding the  war was the greatest national defense program in American history.    On the first count Dewey and his backers had no more faith in the American  farmer than they had in American industrialists and workers. Remember  Dewey's statement that it would be impossible to build 50,000 planes a year?  As to the New Deal farm program and its contribution to our wartime food  supply, we need look only at the benefits to farmers provided by the Rural  Electrification Administration, the TVA and other power projects. In ten  years under REA more than 3 times as many farms were electrified as in the  13 years preceding.    The public works program of the New Deal, so severely criticized by the men  who back Dewey, was responsible for building more than twice as many hard-  surfaced roads as were built in the 13 years preceding. Those roads have  helped revolutionize farm life in the United States.  I    The same critics constantly attacked the Farm Security Administration. They  claimed the FSA misused its authority in ""raising the living standards of  its clients to somewhere near the highest prevailing in a community."" This  philosophy is one of the reason for the reactionaries' attack on . . .    Subsidies . . .    Subsidies help the poorest farmers. In 1942 the FSA was providing help to  464,000 needy farmers and their families. And though the FSA was attacked,  these farmers who were helped have been responsible for much of the increase  in wartime food production. Could there have been any more sound investment  in the defense of our Nation?    For every $1 the Government invested in this worthy enterprise the consumer  saved $20 on his grocery bill, due to increased farm production and the help  subsidies gave in holding the price line.    Now who objects to that?????    V Big Farmers who do not get much subsidy but who would gain greatly from  price rises.    V Middlemen (some of them) who would get high profits from price rises.    V People who just don't like the idea of paying farmers.    V Obstructionists who would love to hinder the war effort and blame the  mess on FDR.    'Mute"
