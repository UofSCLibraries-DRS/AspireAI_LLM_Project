There is still due and unpaid a balance of $150.00 for legal services rendered in connection with the above matter and I am afraid I must insist that it be paid. I would hate to have to bring legal action against the individuals for the collection thereof, but if such be necessary, that is the only course lawyers have to protect themselves in such cases.

Dear Dr. Kelly:

As you may know by this time, I am acting as chairman of the Progressive Democratic Party, recently organized to combat the refusal of the State Democratic Party to permit our people into membership, and committed to the most dramatic action in this connection ever to be seen in the South.

The party will hold its state convention May 24 in the Masonic Temple, 1125 Washington Street, Columbia, beginning at noon of that date. In checking the lists I do not find any kind of delegation listed as from Horry County, and I think it would be most unfortunate that this convention be held, a permanent organization set up, and Horry County not being represented at the proceedings.

A delegation to the Chicago convention will also be selected at this meeting, and disposition partially made of candidates for the November ticket. While I doubt whether you will find time yourself to attend the convention, I am sure you might be able to see to it that some representation comes from Horry County. Such representation may include one or more persons who represent an organization or who are just residents of the county. In the latter case, they would be given delegate status by the convention.

It might interest you to know that Thursday night, at their meeting in Union, D. C., at which I had the honor to deliver an address, the Piedmont Section of the State Medical Association voted unanimously and without request its endorsement of the Progressive Democratic Party and also saw to it that a total of $73.50 was turned over to it with which to carry on the work. The Negro Citizens’ Committee has given its endorsement and is just now preparing a public statement to this effect. Other endorsements are too numerous to mention.

Dear Mr. McCray:

We, the members of the P.D.P. of Newberry, are sending to you, the president of said party, the sum of $50.00. We only wish that we could send more.

As you know, we lost Rev. P. Wallace, the president of our NAACP, who was also a part of this organization, but in spite of that we are endeavoring to carry on."

New York 17, N. Y.

Dear Mr. Foreman:

I apologize for not having replied to your first letter inviting me to membership on the National Citizens Political Action Committee and wish to say that I would consider it an honor to hold membership on the committee. Please so include me and be good enough to inform me of my duties.

It is my belief that nothing should stand in the way of the re-election of President Roosevelt, nor that any person who might be able to contribute to this effort should shirk his duty.

Sincerely yours,
John H. McCray
State Chairman"

The Undoing of the False Prophets

The opponents of the Administration who predicted that we’d not have enough to eat failed to take into account two things:

The determination and vitality of the American people.

The fact that the New Deal farm program of the decade preceding the war was the greatest national defense program in American history.

On the first count, Dewey and his backers had no more faith in the American farmer than they had in American industrialists and workers. Remember Dewey’s statement that it would be impossible to build 50,000 planes a year?

As to the New Deal farm program and its contribution to our wartime food supply, we need look only at the benefits to farmers provided by the Rural Electrification Administration, the TVA, and other power projects. In ten years under REA, more than three times as many farms were electrified as in the 13 years preceding.

The public works program of the New Deal, so severely criticized by the men who back Dewey, was responsible for building more than twice as many hard-surfaced roads as were built in the 13 years preceding. Those roads have helped revolutionize farm life in the United States.

The same critics constantly attacked the Farm Security Administration. They claimed the FSA misused its authority in “raising the living standards of its clients to somewhere near the highest prevailing in a community.” This philosophy is one of the reasons for the reactionaries’ attack on—

Subsidies

Subsidies help the poorest farmers. In 1942 the FSA was providing help to 464,000 needy farmers and their families. And though the FSA was attacked, these farmers who were helped have been responsible for much of the increase in wartime food production. Could there have been any more sound investment in the defense of our Nation?

For every $1 the Government invested in this worthy enterprise, the consumer saved $20 on his grocery bill, due to increased farm production and the help subsidies gave in holding the price line.

Now who objects to that?

✓ Big farmers who do not get much subsidy but who would gain greatly from price rises.
✓ Middlemen (some of them) who would get high profits from price rises.
✓ People who just don’t like the idea of paying farmers.
✓ Obstructionists who would love to hinder the war effort and blame the mess on FDR."

Dear Mr. Fields:

Thanks very much for your letter of February 16, and that additional notation which follows our conversation of a few weeks ago. I am passing both along to Mr. Thurgood Marshall, who is in the process of shaping up the case, with a pertinent suggestion to him. I expect him to be in the state in the near future.

I agree with you the chances of winning at Greenwood appear impossible, yet if it could be so maneuvered that a motion for a directed verdict could be made, I have reasons to believe that such a motion would be cheerfully allowed. I am also of the opinion that the main emphasis at Greenwood should be groundwork for appeal, and that—if at all possible—a precedent as to the granting of changes of venue could be established.

It is my understanding that in criminal courts such changes are allowed to adjoining counties. In the case at hand, however, the prosecuting witness is the solicitor, whose influence covers all counties in the circuit—hardly foreseen by framers of present codes and statutes. I think you can follow my reasoning.

As to possibilities of compromise, nothing is as yet certain, but I understand certain powerful forces, of which I had no knowledge, have been exerting influence, a report on which I expect in the next few days."

It appears that one of the men spoke in a loud and abusive manner and generally conducted himself in a disorderly way. You must realize that we must have respect for the law.

We had very few to vote here in our city. Sixty-four voted for Mr. McKaine in the city. I had sent a good many tickets to Chesterfield, S. C., but don’t know how many voted there. They treated each voter just as nice as you would wish to be treated at the polls.

I was at the polls when they opened here in Cheraw and was the first to vote, white or Black, and asked them if they had our PDP ticket. They told me that they did not, and I told them that I had some and asked if they wanted any of mine. They told me that they did not receive any from the County Chairman and they had better not take any that I had. I told them that I would be on hand all day to give all of my people who wanted to vote our ticket one, and they said that was all right. They let all who came in with our tickets vote without a word.

Just telling you so you will know how it was here in our county and city, not knowing how many all over the county.
