Arthur Pompey 
1615 Fayne Street Columbia, South Carolina 

Dear Mr. Pompey, Jr. James M. Hinton has passed along your statements about me in a letter to him, signed by you, under date August 16. I am pleased to take note of those statements, as set forth immediately herewith. I am sure Hinton can and will ably acquit himself in this instance as he has on many occasions, though for an entirely different cause. However, I do think your letter was a most unfortunate thing, one I am informed was written by another person and, in finality, was based on rank ignorance or a malicious, willful, and deliberate attempt to malign, defame, abuse, and hold in contempt persons and notions which do not deserve them. I am sure ignorance of fact overbalances its evil import.

As count number (1), that is your assertion that I have set myself up as some sort of dictator, permit me to say that only the purblind could make such an assertion. For the 13 years I have been out of college, most of my time has been given to the thankless task of helping those among us who felt as I did to conquer towering problems. To do this, it has meant a huge expenditure of time, resources, what little money I could earn, and much in personal energy and health. You, of course, would not know how much it costs in money alone to keep up correspondence, telephone bills, and even personal contributions for those in distress. And I dare add, you obviously are not concerned about it.

But in all of these years, I have never asked any person for even a penny with which to help, and I have not received one penny; in fact, I would not have accepted had it been so offered. I run the newspaper, as a matter of course. I own it, pay its bills, and solve its problems. I could be called a dictator over it, but only in the business sense and manner of any similarly operated business. I have kept it available, however, to any person or agency wishing to use it, though at times I may have personally disapproved of their objectives and attempts. But I get the impression that you would call me a ""dictator"" over the personal properties and wishes of some of our people.

I am chairman of the Progressive Democrats, and have been since their inauguration in 1944. They have unanimously re-elected me, without opposition, on two occasions, fully aware while so doing that I would have welcomed relief from the duties the office imposes, and the opportunity to settle down to my sole livelihood.

Dr. Peter C. Kelly
Box 98
Conway, S.C.

Dear Dr. Kelly,

As you may know by this time, I am acting as chairman of the Progressive Democratic Party, recently organized to combat the refusal of the State Democratic Party to permit our people into membership, and committed to the most dramatic action in this connection ever to be seen in the South.

The party will hold its state convention May 24 in the Masonic Temple, 1125 Washington Street, Columbia, beginning at noon of that date. In checking the lists I do not find any kind of delegation listed as from Horry County, and I think it would be most unfortunate that this convention be held, a permanent organization set up, and Horry County not being represented at the proceedings.

A delegation to the Chicago convention will also be selected at this meeting, and disposition partially made of candidates for the November ticket. While I doubt whether you will find time yourself to attend the convention, I am sure you might be able to see to it that some representation comes from Horry County. Such representation may include one or more persons who represent an organization or who are just residents of the county. In the latter case, they would be given delegate status by the convention.

It might interest you to know that Thursday night, at their meeting in Union, D. C., at which I had the honor to deliver an address, the Piedmont Section of the State Medical Association voted unanimously and without request its endorsement of the Progressive Democratic Party and also saw to it that a total of $73.50 was turned over to it with which to carry on the work. The Negro Citizens’ Committee has given its endorsement and is just now preparing a public statement to this effect. Other endorsements are too numerous to mention.

Dear Mr. Floyd,

Because of scheduled arrangements, it is impossible to meet with you October 4th as suggested in your letter of September 29, 1944. However, I will be glad to attend a meeting in Horry County Wednesday evening, October 11th, and attend to the business mentioned by you.

Dear Mr. Floyd:

Thank you for your letter of October 6th instructing me where to stop in Conway Wednesday evening. I am inclined to believe, however, that your meeting should not start earlier than 8:00 P.M. However, I shall try to be there by 6:30.

I would suggest that a strenuous effort be made before that time to have as many persons as possible present. Personally, I am looking forward to the biggest meeting ever held in your Congressional District.

Dear Mr. McCray:

I have just received a letter from Mr. Marsden Cabell, Publicity Director of the National Council of Negro Democrats, requesting that I contact twenty of the Negro leaders in South Carolina for the purpose of having them wire or write President Truman, urging him to appoint Senator Harley M. Kilgore to the office of Secretary of Labor.

The national office has been authentically informed that his appointment is being considered. The national office approves his appointment because of his liberalism and fairness to our people; therefore, any assistance we can render warrants our wholehearted support.

I want to ask that you wire or write President Truman at once urging the appointment of Senator Kilgore. Give this matter your immediate attention, and send me a copy of your letter or telegram. I have wired President Truman.

Awaiting your immediate reply, I am cordially yours,
Yours, Drake",,44509,44509,http://cdm17173.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p17173coll38/id/3905,3905,4254.jp2,/p17173coll38/image/4254.jp2,1945

Dear Mr. Blackman,

We certainly are looking forward to Marlboro County coming through 100% on its full quota. We believe you have observed that the entire state is quite excited about what is going to happen where Negro participation is concerned in the Democratic Party both in our state and at the Philadelphia Convention.

The officials of our Party are at Beaufort tonight in an effort to keep the regular Democrats from removing from the enrollment books the thirty-two Negroes that have enrolled there. All of these fights in all of these counties naturally entail a volume of expenses, and we have to depend upon all of our counties doing their share.

We are therefore advising our State Treasurer that your remittance will be in around July 7. Certainly, we will be happy to serve you in any manner that you may request after the National Convention.

We shall look forward to hearing from you.

We are also members of the N.A.A.C.P., and here at home we are known as “The Fellowship Club.” Our next meeting will be held next Saturday at the Bethlehem Baptist Church, of which I am pastor; the time is 2 P.M.

We are sending a large delegation down to your meeting Wednesday coming — look for us. Newberry is with you one hundred percent.

Dear Mr. Morgan,

Our legal action committee has authorized me to prepare, through the county organization for Marion, a case against the Board of Registration, data for the action to be gathered on October 1, 1945, which is Monday coming and the date provided by law for registration during that month. The committee decided upon the action after studying at length a number of statements from your county which have been referred to it, dealing with divers schemes employed, or apparently employed, by the Board at Marion for the sole purpose of abridging the rights of Negroes to qualify and to prepare for voting as are outlined in both the federal and state constitutions.

Among the complaints in this office are those alleging that Board members deliberately absent themselves when Negroes appear or, as if forewarned by a sentry, avoid Negro applicants. We are ready to move off on this scheme used against us. Marion County has been selected as the testing ground.

As county chairman, together with our secretary, Mr. George H. Chism, you are requested to take as many persons to Marion as possible, and have your various precinct leaders in all sections of the county do likewise. You are further requested to have put into affidavit form within 48 hours of October 1 individual cases of irregularities.

You of course know that state law offers registration to all citizens 21 years of age or over who own and have paid all collectible taxes on $300 or more worth of real estate, or to those who, lacking the real estate qualification, can both read and write any section of the state constitution of 1895 the office might submit. Any action beyond these provisions are violations.

The Honorable Earle R. Ellerbe
State Senator
Marion County
Marion, S.C.

Dear Sir,

I wish again to call to your attention certain irregularities surrounding the registration board in Marion County, having first done so a little over one month ago.

During registration hours on Monday, Nov. 5, 1945, about one hundred and sixty-two (162) colored citizens in Marion County presented themselves at the county courthouse, before the Honorable F. M. Boatwright, reported to be the Registration Board chairman, and another unnamed man. It is believed that the names and addresses of these people are in the possession of the two men.

The first applying person was compelled to read the entire State Constitution and afterwards “interpret” it. At his protest, the same was not requested of all successive applicants. The registration officer (chairman) is reported by numerous persons under oath to have ignored tax receipts of persons who, under the state constitution, are entitled to voting certificates without the literacy test, being told they “mean nothing.”

We are striving earnestly to avoid unnecessary actions to have the State and Federal Constitutions observed in the process of registration in Marion County and appeal to you finally to take such action as may be necessary to insure proper and due processes in this respect.

CC: Mr. Boatwright

Very truly yours,
John H. McCray",,44509,44509,http://cdm17173.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p17173coll38/id/4033,4033,4382.jp2,/p17173coll38/image/4382.jp2,1945

This acknowledges receipt of one hundred dollars ($100.00) from Progressive Democrats in Marion County. This money is being turned over to State Treasurer J. C. Artanus, who will issue an official receipt, and will be credited against the 1948 assessment of Marion County.

We are making good progress and suggest to you to continue raising money which can be used in your own area or elsewhere in the state to finish the battle.

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your very fine support for the Re-elect Truman Campaign, and the amount of $250.00 from Marion County. We are very pleased to receive this report; however, we note a discrepancy of $20.00 in the breakdown of precincts, which totals $270.00, while the money orders are for $250.00.

BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA (National Office)
2 Park Avenue
New York 16, N. Y.

On or after Feb. 3, 1945

BOY SCOUT WEEK IS Feb. 8th to 14th

The Boy Scouts of the nation, observing their 36th anniversary during Boy Scout Week, Feb. 8th to 14th, are helping brother Scouts in war-torn lands through an unusual project known as the “Shirts-Off-Our-Backs” Campaign.

Now numbering nearly two million, the Boy Scouts and their leaders are contributing used but clean and serviceable Scout uniform parts and camping equipment to help boys overseas resume their Scouting activities. A special effort is being made during February to call at homes of former members for Scout uniforms and accessories no longer needed.

In approving this nation-wide effort, the National Executive Board of the Boy Scouts of America emphasized that the collection is not to be thought of as charity, but instead a sharing by one Scout with another. Scouts are giving up parts of their uniforms and equipment that they may not be able to replace soon, but Scout Leaders feel this helpfulness will create an interest on the part of American Scouts in brother Scouts in other lands, their customs and history.

Since each Scout donor is asked to include his name and address on the equipment, it is felt that friendships thus formed will contribute to world-wide understanding.

Usable uniform parts being collected include Boy Scout and Cub Scout shirts (without badges), hats and caps, shorts, neckerchiefs and slides, lanyards, belts, stockings, and shoes.

Equipment desired for shipment overseas includes axes, knives, mess kits, duffel bags, haversacks, sleeping bags, tents, bugles, compasses, fire-making sets, first aid kits, signaling flags, whistles, and Scout literature.

The World Friendship Fund, consisting of voluntary contributions by Boy Scouts, will defray all shipping costs.",,44512,44512,http://cdm17173.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p17173coll38/id/4696,4696,5219.jp2,/p17173coll38/image/5219.jp2,1945

The Negro Division of Richland County has set as its goal $2,500 of the county’s quota. As drive chairman for the Negro Division, I am asking that you serve as Assistant Chairman of the Professional and Business Group Committee.

That we might have a coordinated campaign, I am wondering if you might not be good enough to meet in my office at 7:00 P.M., Tuesday, March 6, at which meeting other chairmen will be present.

Sincerely yours,

On November 13, 1943, he demanded “an immediate change” in Administration policies, and warned that the people “will suffer grave hardship in impairment of their health and production.”

The Undoing of the False Prophets

The opponents of the Administration who predicted that we’d not have enough to eat failed to take into account two things:

The determination and vitality of the American people.

The fact that the New Deal farm program of the decade preceding the war was the greatest national defense program in American history.

On the first count, Dewey and his backers had no more faith in the American farmer than they had in American industrialists and workers. Remember Dewey’s statement that it would be impossible to build 50,000 planes a year?

As to the New Deal farm program and its contribution to our wartime food supply, we need look only at the benefits to farmers provided by the Rural Electrification Administration, the TVA, and other power projects. In ten years under REA, more than three times as many farms were electrified as in the 13 years preceding.

The public works program of the New Deal, so severely criticized by the men who back Dewey, was responsible for building more than twice as many hard-surfaced roads as were built in the 13 years preceding. Those roads have helped revolutionize farm life in the United States.

The same critics constantly attacked the Farm Security Administration. They claimed the FSA misused its authority in “raising the living standards of its clients to somewhere near the highest prevailing in a community.” This philosophy is one of the reasons for the reactionaries’ attack on—

Subsidies

Subsidies help the poorest farmers. In 1942 the FSA was providing help to 464,000 needy farmers and their families. And though the FSA was attacked, these farmers who were helped have been responsible for much of the increase in wartime food production. Could there have been any more sound investment in the defense of our Nation?

For every $1 the Government invested in this worthy enterprise, the consumer saved $20 on his grocery bill, due to increased farm production and the help subsidies gave in holding the price line.

Now who objects to that?

✓ Big farmers who do not get much subsidy but who would gain greatly from price rises.
✓ Middlemen (some of them) who would get high profits from price rises.
✓ People who just don’t like the idea of paying farmers.
✓ Obstructionists who would love to hinder the war effort and blame the mess on FDR.",,44515,44515,http://cdm17173.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p17173coll38/id/5268,5268,5878.jp2,/p17173coll38/image/5878.jp2,1944

The founders of our wonderous band,
In numbers, though were three;
Taught ideals high, which soon became,
A part of every Phi.
Said they, “Our cause let us make heard,
Oh, Brother don’t dismay,
Faint not, fight on, for in this wise,
Our cause speeds on its way.”

From western plains to eastern hills
There comes a shout of praise,
A shout which tells of victory,
Bids Beta Sigma raise,
A shout which swells to loud hurrahs
And to us seems to say:
“Fear not, fight on, for our cause speeds
Nobly on its way.”

March on, march on, ye mighty host,
Nor think the journey done;
Nor of future deeds to boast,
Till we’ve the victory won.
Then when we hear, from time to time,
Sigma, what of the day?
We’ll thunder back along the line;
Our cause speeds on its way.

You’ve always stood for right,
Rather than for the might;
We’ll love you ever,
Forsake you never,

Dear Mr. Fields,

Thanks very much for your letter of February 16, and that additional notation which follows our conversation of a few weeks ago. I am passing both along to Mr. Thurgood Marshall, who is in the process of shaping up the case, with a pertinent suggestion to him. I expect him to be in the state in the near future.

I agree with you the chances of winning at Greenwood appear impossible, yet if it could be so maneuvered that a motion for a directed verdict could be made, I have reasons to believe that such a motion would be cheerfully allowed. I am also of the opinion that the main emphasis at Greenwood should be groundwork for appeal, and that—if at all possible—a precedent as to the granting of changes of venue could be established.

It is my understanding that in criminal courts such changes are allowed to adjoining counties. In the case at hand, however, the prosecuting witness is the solicitor, whose influence covers all counties in the circuit—hardly foreseen by framers of present codes and statutes. I think you can follow my reasoning.

As to possibilities of compromise, nothing is as yet certain, but I understand certain powerful forces, of which I had no knowledge, have been exerting influence, a report on which I expect in the next few days.",,44516,44516,http://cdm17173.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p17173coll38/id/6292,6292,6902.jp2,/p17173coll38/image/6902.jp2,1950

Dear Sir,

I have investigated the case you recently reported to me in which two Negro soldiers became involved in a bus episode and were carried down to Police Headquarters and charged with disorderly conduct. It appears that one of the men spoke in a loud and abusive manner and generally conducted himself in a disorderly way. You must realize that we must have respect for the law.

In regard to manhandling prisoners, I have on more than one occasion talked to the police about this. I have talked to them as a whole and I have sent messages to them through the Chief as to my policy in this regard. I do not approve of manhandling and I have, on at least one occasion, suspended an officer for it. I realize the police officers have to protect themselves and I certainly do not want them shot or beaten up by being over-polite to the men whom they arrest. At the same time, I do not want them to take advantage of their authority and of the badge and uniform which they wear.

In this particular instance, I have had the officer involved up to my office and I have let him understand personally just what my policy is in this matter. Any treatment that the soldier you have in mind may have had in this case was certainly not because of his race. Had he",,44518,44518,http://cdm17173.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p17173coll38/id/7526,7526,8136.jp2,/p17173coll38/image/8136.jp2,1946

My Dear Mr. McCray,

We had very few to vote here in our city. Sixty-four voted for Mr. McKaine in the city. I had sent a good many tickets to Chesterfield, S. C., but don’t know how many voted there. They treated each voter just as nice as you would wish to be treated at the polls.

I was at the polls when they opened here in Cheraw and was the first to vote, white or Black, and asked them if they had our PDP ticket. They told me that they did not, and I told them that I had some and asked if they wanted any of mine. They told me that they did not receive any from the County Chairman and they had better not take any that I had. I told them that I would be on hand all day to give all of my people who wanted to vote our ticket one, and they said that was all right. They let all who came in with our tickets vote without a word.

Just telling you so you will know how it was here in our county and city, not knowing how many all over the county.

Hoping you the best of health.",,44519,44519,http://cdm17173.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p17173coll38/id/7639,7639,8249.jp2,/p17173coll38/image/8249.jp2,1944

Dear Mr. McCray:

I had your letter from Mr. A. J. Clement of Charleston, S. C., about our meeting at Conway Wednesday. If you write him, tell him that my bus will leave Cheraw at 10:30 o’clock A.M., so you see I will get there as soon Wednesday as I can.

Yours truly,",,44519,44519,http://cdm17173.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p17173coll38/id/7654,7654,8264.jp2,/p17173coll38/image/8264.jp2,1945

Dear Mr. McCray,

Very sorry that I cannot be with you today; it just happened so at the last minute that I will have to be here at home. But anything that you all may do for the betterment of us all, I am with you 100 percent. Just let me know and I will do the best I know to do in this county.

Hoping that you will have a good meeting with much good coming out of it. Let me hear from you soon.",,44519,44519,http://cdm17173.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p17173coll38/id/7667,7667,8277.jp2,/p17173coll38/image/8277.jp2,1946
